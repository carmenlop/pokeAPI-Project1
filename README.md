# Pokemon API Project

This is a project fetching information from a Pokemon API and displaying it for the user. There is an input search bar for the user where a pokemon name is filled, when submitted a fetch request is initiated. The data pulled is then displayed for the user, and based on the user's pokemon type, there is a second fetch initiated on the pokemon type (electric, fire, grass, etc.). This app is in the first version of development.
